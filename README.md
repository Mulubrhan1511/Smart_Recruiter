# Project Title: "SmartRecruit: Streamlined Recruitment and Onboarding System"

## Project Description:

Create a simple web-based application called **"Application Tracker"** that provides a dashboard to track the progress of job applications during the recruitment process. The project aims to provide HR professionals with a quick overview of the application status and includes email notifications for rejection and acceptance within a week.

## Key Features:

1. **Job Posting and Application Submission:**
   - Enable HR professionals to post job openings with basic details such as job title, description, and requirements.
   - Allow candidates to submit their applications by providing their contact information and uploading their resumes.

2. **Application Management:**
   - Provide a centralized dashboard to view and manage all job applications.
   - Display a list of submitted applications with relevant candidate details and the date of submission.

3. **Application Status Tracking:**
   - Implement a simple status tracking system for each application, such as "Received," "Under Review," "Interview Scheduled," or "Rejected."
   - Allow HR professionals to update the application status manually as the recruitment process progresses.

4. **Email Notifications:**
   - Implement automated email notifications to inform candidates about the status of their applications.
   - Send rejection emails to candidates when their applications are marked as "Rejected."
   - Send acceptance emails to candidates when their applications are marked as "Accepted."

5. **Basic Reporting:**
   - Generate a basic report summarizing the number of applications received, the status distribution (e.g., number of applications in each status category), and the overall progress of the recruitment process.

6. **Application Sorting:**
   - Allow HR professionals to sort applications based on different criteria such as date of submission, candidate name, or application status. This will help them organize and prioritize applications effectively.

7. **Application Duplication Prevention:**
   - Implement a check to prevent duplicate applications by the same candidate for the same job opening. This can help maintain data accuracy and avoid confusion during the evaluation process.

8. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement a user authentication system to ensure only authorized HR professionals can access and manage applications.

9. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure the web application is responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing HR professionals to access and manage applications on various devices.

10. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Design a clean and intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate, reducing the learning curve for HR professionals using the application.
